# Consumer Sensory Evaluation Dashboard

<h2>Description</h2>

This is a demo version of a real project I worked on where I was tasked with creating a dashboard to automate the reporting of periodic consumer sensory evaluation experiment for major shortbread biscuit brand

This was one of my most challenging projects for several reasons:
    1. This was my first time using PowerBI for a dashboard project
    2. The dataset was unstructured
    3. The dashboard has to report on several metrics and enabled historical comparison of metrics
    4. Some of evaluations like Hypothesis testing could not be done natively in PowerBI

The dashboard has the following features;
1. Historical comparision of top box and mean scores
2. Hypothesis testing
3. Relevant filters to enable slicing of the report
4. Enhanced preattentive features to reduce time to insight
